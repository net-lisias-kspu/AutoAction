* 2014-1224: 1.2.1 (Diazo) for KSP 0.90
	+ Add ability to override career mode lockout on action groups so this mod will show even if action groups are not yet unlocked.
	+ Note that only shows this mod, another mod is required in order actually assign actions in early career mode. (Action Groups Extended is one that does.)
	+ To enable: KSP-Install\GameData\Diazo\AutoAction\AutoAction.cfg
		- Change OverrideCareer = 0 to 1
		- Value of 0: Respect KSP's action group lockout
		- Value of 1: Ignore the lockout and always show this mod.
